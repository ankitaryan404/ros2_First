# ros2_First
This is a basic ROS2 project that demonstrates the use of publishers and subscribers in ROS2. In this project, we have created a simple publisher node that sends messages and a subscriber node that receives those messages. Additionally, two custom message types are used to share data between the nodes.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/crystal/Installation/Linux-Install-Binary.html) or a later version installed on your system.

## Installation and Setup

1. Create a new ROS2 workspace. If you don't have one, you can follow these steps to create a workspace:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/your_workspace/src
   cd ~/your_workspace
   colcon build
   source ~/your_workspace/install/setup.bash


```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitaryan404/ros2_First.git
```
